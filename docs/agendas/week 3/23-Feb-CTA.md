# Questions for the Client TA meeting: 
1. Are students allowed to reply to each other? With the questions? 
2. Who should be able to see the list of participants? Everyone in the current session, right? 
3. Should the moderator be able to hide and delete questions? What difference does this imply? Is there any difference? Should there be this difference and is it enough to realise just one of them? 
4. Should everyone be able to to see the questions in multiple sorted orders? Should that only be for the moderators/lecturers? (I have it for all users currently)
5. What if the host(lecturer) disconnects? What should happen? 
6. Can anyone immediately enter the lecture session or should that only happen with the permission of the host(lecturer)? 
7. Should these polls include the names of students? 
8. Should there be a limit of the number of participants in a session? e.g. Bongo has a limit of 150. 
9. Does their have to be a statistic that indicates that a question should be merged? Isn't the TA the best judge for this? And not an algorithm or statistic? 
10. When there is no moderator, the lecturer plays the role of the moderator? 
11. After questions are merged, should the merged question still be accessible(found somehow)? Or should only the merged result question be shown?
