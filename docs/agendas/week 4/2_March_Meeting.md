# Questions for the TA

* Should we worry about the Docker now or should we just stick to finishing the minimum viable requirements?
* I don't really understand how sockets are not used. How would you recommend implementing multiple connections to one session?
* How would you recommend setting up a secure session? Using a special code or a URL? Should we clarify this with the CTA again?
* Is it okay if we check up the design of the application with you? 

# Question round
