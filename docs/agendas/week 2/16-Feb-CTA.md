# Meeting Agenda Week 2 CTA
---

Date:           16 February 2021\
Main focus:     CTA Backlog\
Chair:          Victoria\
Note taker:     Sergio

# Opening
First 10 min CTA talks, then 10 min for questions.

# Goal
1.	Together with CTA checkmark requirements for each Nielsen heuristic (these are not necessary for this assignment in particular (but for HCI assignment) but they also provide a structure of the product charactersitics that we can use as a reference for the requirements) and for each sub-division of types of requirements (user, system, functional, non-functional). Or perhaps the CTA is not technical at all and leaves the system/non-functional requirements up to us?
    * Ellicitate requirements on 16 Feb with the CTA.
    * Specifiy requirements on our own.
    * Validate requirements with CTA on 23 Feb.
2.	After the meeting we will make wireframes/sketches of the product and an document the requirements in an organized way.
3.	Agree with the CTA that on the 23rd we will deliver the models and the documentation and the goal for that day is:
    * Validate documented requirements
    * Negotiate requirements (MSCW), to determine the minimum viable product.

# Next up
1. The meeting for 16th March is just a catchup to communicate progress.
2. Therefore the “Design HCI” assignment deadline of 15 March, 2021 23:59 will be changed to an internal deadline for the 1st half (sketch model) for the 23rd of Feb (so we can show it to the client already). Then once the client approves it we can analyze it with a survey and improve it further based on the survey results.
