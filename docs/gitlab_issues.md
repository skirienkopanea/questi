# Documentation for GitLab Issues


## Branches

1. Make a `develop` branch in parallel with `master`
2. Once you pick an issue and you are the assignee, create a new branch for that specific feature/issue. 


## Labels 

> For issues, commits, merge request 

* **Priority** Label: High, Medium, Low
* **Urgency/Impact** Label: Urgent, Not Urgent 
* **Hot - fix** 
* **Bugs**
* **Doing/Reviewing/Done** 
* **Documentation (for the agendas)**
* **Difficulty** Level: Easy/Medium/Difficult

(for back-end/ui, see the milestone)

### What labels *must* we use (add to code of conduct as well)
* Priority label
* Urgency label
* If it is a bug/hotfix, please add the relevant label
* For branches, add the "doing, done, reviewing" labels. This is not needed for commits
