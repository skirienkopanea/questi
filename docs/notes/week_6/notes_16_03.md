## Main talking points 

* **Don't forget about the buddycheck assignment**
* In week 9, we can make a trial presentation or send a video to Ana
* The final presentation will be a video
* Sergio presented some **great** tests on the server, however they're out of scope for this project
* All controller methods should be tested on the server
* The test coverage and the line coverage should be a decent one (preferably 100%)
* We should check Mocking for the controllers tests 
* Stick with Junit for the entities
* Constructor in the controller is weird but it works
* The issues need to be "refreshed"
* Mocking can be achieved with Mockito
* We still need to work on the communication side of the team
 



## Main achievements
* Connection between client and server
* Basic functionalities of Student and Moderator screens
* The entities are finished, fields are final 

### Have a productive week everyone, we got this!!
