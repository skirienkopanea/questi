## Rundown on what everyone did:

### Backend Team (Alex, Teo, Victoria)

* Connected PostgreSQL database to PGAdmin Server and to app
* Created Enitities, Services, Controllers & Repositories for each Table

### Frontend Team (Elena, Sergio, Ahmed)

* Created views: moderator, student, home, schedule
* Did controllers
* Did buttons

#### Sergio did the report, some team members still need to proofread it, afterwards it is done.

## General feedback

* We need to push changes we do each sprint to master, so Ana can see them;
* We need to write tests for everything pushed to master - frontend needs to test entities, backend needs to test everything;
* DO NOT approve your own merge requests;
* In an ideal world, code in merge requests should be reviewed before being approved;
* Before approving a merge request, we should wait for the pipeline to succeed;
* Alex is not assigned any issues;
* We need to assign issues when we start working on them;

### Happy International Women's Day!!
